## Image segmentation based on ColourÂ Masking



The prerequisite of this method is obviously that the relevant object should be differently colored than the background of the image. A typical example of this is extraction of foliage from background dirt for plant identification.<br/>

 The Target Image is first converted to HSV image:<br/>

 <br/>
 The HSV image is then thesholded and is further masked to create the segmented image:<br/>
